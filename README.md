# Resistor Scanner - Kotlin-based Phone Application

Resistor Scanner is a phone application that uses OpenCV to scan and detect the value of a resistor based on its color bands. The application has been re-written in Kotlin from the original Java code and developed using Android Studio.

## Features

- Scan and detect resistor values by analyzing color bands
- Visual display of color bands with their corresponding values
- Option to change the number of bands to scan (4 or 5)
- Supports both portrait and landscape orientations
- Simple and easy to use interface

## Prerequisites

- Android device running Android 5.0 or above

- Minimum SDK version supported: 21

- OpenCV library included in the project

### Installation and Usage

To install and use Resistor Scanner:

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to your preferred location.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Connect your Android device to your computer and run the application on your device.

#### How to Use Resistor Scanner

Resistor Scanner is an Android phone application that allows users to detect the value of a resistor by analyzing its color bands. To use the app, simply select the number of bands to scan (4 or 5), point the camera of your device towards the resistor, adjust its position within the frame, and press the "Scan" button to initiate the scanning process. The app will then analyze the colors of the resistor bands and display the value of the resistor in ohms, along with the corresponding color bands.
